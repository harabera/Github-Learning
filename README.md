This is a review of python libraries. More to the point, it's also a quick overview for a rank beginner of how to actually commit things to Git. Yes...that's right...truley clueless, but intrigued to learn how not only to use GitHub, define a desktop and cloud repository but to eventually enter into a collaborative coding project. In the meantime, really loved the review of the python statistics library. Literally, haven't thought meaningfully about statistics in 40 years (or ever?), but delightfully tracked down the difference between covariance and correlation. It seems that beyond simply measuring the relationship between two variables...correlation also seems to measure the strength (whereas covariance measures whether they're just related linearly (or directionally). Hmm. Ok, then why would you ever use covariance vs. correlation? My next light weight search indicated that covariance shows how two variables are different vs. correlation shows how they're related. Yeah but... finally happened uon https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/139476/why-is-pure-sample-covariance-a-bad-metric-to-understand-the-degree-of-correlati#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20reasons%20covariance,and%20b%20be%20real%20numbers...and they seemed to have nice overview... 

Yikes...the statics module really was a whole lesson in itself... my next question was what's the difference between geometric mean vs arithmetic mean. Ok, geometric mean wins out here because it takes in account compounding that occurs over time... They're calculated differently...suffice to say, if you're using data that has any internal compounding, decaying, growth going on (say finance or even biology)...geometric might be the way to go.  

Anyway, all this is to say, that will have to brush up on stats...
